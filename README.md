# sarissas-clone

This is a copy of [Sarissa](http://dev.abiss.gr/sarissa/).
I am not at all affiliated with that project.

No plans to alter code for now. Just wanted to see a copy on Git/Github.

User "volkertb" is maintaining this more actively at <https://github.com/volkertb/sarissa>
(with `master` to be kept in sync with the original CVS with other branches
adding his own improvements). He also has a ready-to-use sarissa.js build (with
passing tests and recent patches and fixes) built from the 0.9.9.7-SNAPSHOT
branch on a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/volkertb/bd39dad1e7eeb17730e4).
